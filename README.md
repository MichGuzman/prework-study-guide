## Description
As you work through this prework, you'll dive into the foundational skills, mindsets, and technologies that all web developers use. You'll also have opportunities to practice the habits and tasks that web developers complete every day in a professional context that mirrors what you will experience in the classroom and in your career. Finally, you'll build and deploy a simple web application that you can show off to your friends and family.


-What was your motivation?Learning web development empowers you to create digital experiences that millions of people use every day. With web development skills, you can transform ideas into working applications, solve real-world problems, and participate in creating the technology that shapes our world. Plus, web development is a skill that is constantly in demand, opening up numerous career opportunities, both in large companies and in personal projects. Learning these skills not only provides you with a solid foundation for your career, but also gives you the satisfaction of seeing the direct impact of your work online, accessible from anywhere in the world.
-Why did you build this project? I built this project to put into practice the fundamental web development concepts and skills I've learned.
-What problem does it solve? This project not only helps me practice and consolidate my knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, but also solves the problem of how to build an interactive and visually appealing web page using these fundamental technologies.
-What did you learn?Through this project, I learned how to use HTML to structure content on a web page in a semantic and accessible way. With CSS, I gained skills in designing and styling the page, learning how to work with layouts, colors, typography, and visual effects that enhance the user experience. Additionally, by using JavaScript, I was able to add interactivity to the page, such as responding to user actions and dynamically manipulating the site's content. I also learned about the integration of these three technologies and how to work with them together to create a functional web application. In short, this project allowed me to understand how the fundamentals of web development work and how they can be applied to create rich, interactive websites.
